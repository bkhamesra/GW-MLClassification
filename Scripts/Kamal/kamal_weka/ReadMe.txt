 
Please use the csv file weka_sharma_ravi.csv for WEKA. If not readily usable, try to bring it to usable form.
The first row is just attribute index. The real data begins from the second row.
Class Labels are in the last column. They are numbers because it was easier to output from matlab. But these numbers mean something.
Look at the table below.

Class Label	Numeric Label
Precessing	9999
AlignedSpins	2222
NonSpinning	1111

So for example if last column of any row says "9999" then the row corresponds to Precessing black holes.
Have fun.
